in this problem there will be a 2d arary
competetion = [
    ["html", "c#],
    ["c#", "python"],
    ["python", "html"]
]

result = [0,0,1] , this represent the winner (0 means index 1 is winner, 1 means index 0 is the winner),
resutl[0] means 0 row,  and so one.

each winner got 3 point for every win, so you have to find the best team (maximum points)

the approach is:

- create two variable , best_team, best_team_score
- create a map to store the score of winners
- loop through the competition array.
- i[result[i] == 0  ? 1 : 0]
- add this string to the map and add 3(win point)
- now compare wiht `best_team_score` if greater than `best_team_score` then update it with best_team
- then finally you will get the winner

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func winIdx(value int) int {
	if value == 0 {
		return 1
	} else {
		return 0
	}
}

func main() {
	arr := [3][2]string{
		{"html", "c#"},
		{"c#", "pyton"},
		{"pyton", "c#"},
	}

	myMap := make(map[string]int)
	score := []int{0, 0, 1}
	bestTeam := ""
	bestTeamScore := 0

	for idx, value := range arr {
		myMap[value[winIdx(score[idx])]] += 3
		if myMap[value[winIdx(score[idx])]] > bestTeamScore {
			bestTeamScore = myMap[value[winIdx(score[idx])]]
			bestTeam = value[winIdx(score[idx])]
		}
	}

	fmt.Println(bestTeam, bestTeamScore)
}

```
